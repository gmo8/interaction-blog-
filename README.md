### Art Piece 1

My first piece is Darwin Straw Mirror. I thought this piece was really impressive because each straw was placed randomly, rotates randomly, and has a random color. Then, through "selection" the program picks out a shape infront of the camera and moves straws to morph the shape. Then, if the person infront of the camera stops moving, the piece will begin to blur. I liked this piece because it was very thoughtful and was a really fun analogy to the theory of evolution. I do wonder why Daniel chose to use straws as the foundational building block of the mirror. I wonder if it is because he can make the immage blur easier with the straws? And I an a bit confused on why the image blurs when he stops moving. I feel like he is trying to say that if there are no evolutionary pressures on an organism, it will not change?

### Art Piece 2

The other piece I chose was called Pixel by Jamie Zigelbaum. I chose this piece because I liked the idea that every single pixel in a computer must be stop on for a screen to look decent. This piece is fun because the person interacting has control of every pixel and can make individual pixels interact with eachother. To me, this piece really makes me appreciate codng becuase all these large pixels in this piece can do is change colors, just like a screen. With 5 or 10 pixels not much is possible, but if you had 1000 of these pixels you can create so much more.
